  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I'm Nqobile Hlongwane, an enthusiastic IT graduate from Tshwane University of Technology with a passion for full-stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in Phola township and developed my skills through projects, volunteering, and hands-on experience. My goal is to use technology to solve real-world problems and help others learn through tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve built real-world applications, like an LMS for managing online education, and continue to grow my knowledge in AI, cloud, and web technologies.
